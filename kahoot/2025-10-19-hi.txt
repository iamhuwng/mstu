> Describe the layout and all interactions and functions in quizz page after admin start a quiz 

● I'll describe the complete layout and functionality of the Teacher Quiz Page based on the
  TeacherQuizPage.jsx file.

  Overall Layout Structure

  The Teacher Quiz Page uses a three-section layout with responsive design:

  Top Section: Two-Column Layout (Questions & Passage)

  Desktop (>768px width):
  - Left Column (Resizable): Questions and Answer Aggregation
    - Default width: 600px
    - Min width: 300px, Max width: 900px
    - Resizable via drag handle on right edge
    - Contains:
        - Quiz title
      - Timer display (if question has timer)
      - Current question (rendered via QuestionRenderer)
      - Answer Aggregation Display (shows student response statistics)
  - Right Column (Flexible): Passage/Material Display
    - Takes remaining width
    - Shows quiz-level or question-level passage
    - Question-level passage takes precedence over quiz-level

  Mobile (<768px width):
  - Stacks vertically instead of side-by-side
  - Questions section first (max-height: 50vh)
  - Passage section second (max-height: 50vh)
  - Both sections scrollable independently

  ---
  Bottom Section: Teacher Controls & Management

  Three subsections stacked vertically:

  1. Rocket Race - Live Leaderboard
  - Visual chart showing all players' scores
  - Updates in real-time as students answer
  - White background with rounded corners

  2. Teacher Controls
  - Next Question button: Advances to next question (disabled on last question)
  - Pause/Resume button: Toggles game pause state
  - Finish Quiz button: Appears only on last question, navigates to results

  3. Two-Column Management Panel (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile)

  Left: Players List
  - Shows count: "Players (N)"
  - Each player displays:
    - Player name
    - Red "Kick" button
  - Clicking Kick:
    - Shows confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to kick this player?"
    - If confirmed: Bans player's IP and removes from game

  Right: IP Ban Panel
  - Shows all banned IPs
  - Each IP has "Unban" button
  - Clicking Unban removes IP from ban list

  ---
  Core Functions & Interactions

  Data Management

  useEffect (lines 22-34): Loads game session and quiz data
  - Listens to Firebase path: game_sessions/{gameSessionId}
  - When game session loads, fetches associated quiz from quizzes/{quizId}
  - Real-time updates via Firebase onValue listener

  useEffect (lines 36-42): Responsive layout handler
  - Detects window resize events
  - Updates isSmallScreen state when crossing 768px threshold
  - Cleans up listener on unmount

  ---
  Navigation & Flow Control

  handleNextQuestion() (lines 44-52)
  - Increments currentQuestionIndex by 1
  - Only works if not on last question
  - Updates Firebase: game_sessions/{gameSessionId}/currentQuestionIndex
  - Triggers automatic navigation for all connected students

  handlePause() (lines 54-59)
  - Toggles isPaused state in Firebase
  - Affects timer display (pauses/resumes countdown)
  - All students see paused state simultaneously

  ---
  Player Management

  handleKickPlayer(playerId) (lines 61-71)
  1. Shows browser confirmation dialog
  2. If confirmed:
    - Retrieves player's IP address from gameSession.players[playerId].ip
    - Adds IP to ban list: game_sessions/{gameSessionId}/bannedIps/{ip-with-dashes}
    - Note: IPs stored with dashes instead of dots (e.g., "192-168-1-100")
    - Removes player: game_sessions/{gameSessionId}/players/{playerId}
  3. Player immediately disconnected and cannot rejoin

  handleUnbanIp(ip) (lines 73-76)
  - Removes IP from ban list
  - Player can rejoin game with new session
  - IP format converted from dots to dashes for Firebase path

  ---
  Component Breakdown

  QuestionRenderer (line 118, 159)

  - Displays current question based on type
  - Handles: multiple-choice, multiple-select, completion, matching, diagram-labeling
  - Props: question object

  TimerDisplay (lines 109-116, 150-157)

  - Shows countdown timer if question has timer property
  - Props:
    - totalTime: seconds for question
    - isPaused: pause state
    - size: 150px diameter

  PassageRenderer (lines 134, 171)

  - Displays passage/material for question
  - Supports text, image, video, audio, PDF types
  - Shows "No passage provided" if null
  - Props: passage object (question-level overrides quiz-level)

  AnswerAggregationDisplay (lines 120-125, 161-166)

  - Shows aggregated student responses (NOT individual answers)
  - Displays counts and percentages
  - Props:
    - players: all game session players
    - questionIndex: current question number
    - question: question object

  RocketRaceChart (line 193)

  - Animated leaderboard visualization
  - Shows player rankings and scores
  - Props: players object

  TeacherControlPanel (lines 205-211)

  - Control buttons for quiz flow
  - Props:
    - onNextQuestion: callback function
    - onPause: callback function
    - isPaused: boolean state
    - isLastQuestion: boolean (changes Next → Finish)

  IPBanPanel (line 255)

  - Banned IP management interface
  - Props:
    - bannedIPs: array of IPs (converted from Firebase format)
    - onUnban: callback function

  ---
  State & Data Flow

  Local State:
  - gameSession: Current game session data (players, settings, state)
  - quiz: Quiz data (questions, title, passages)
  - isSmallScreen: Boolean for responsive layout

  Computed Values:
  - currentQuestionIndex: From gameSession or 0
  - currentQuestion: quiz.questions[currentQuestionIndex]
  - isLastQuestion: Boolean check if on last question
  - effectivePassage: Question passage || quiz passage || null (line 87)

  Real-time Sync:
  - All Firebase updates trigger re-renders
  - Multiple teachers can view same session
  - Students automatically sync when teacher advances questions

  ---
  Key Behaviors

  1. Loading State: Shows "Loading..." until both gameSession and quiz data loaded (lines 78-80)
  2. Passage Priority: Question-level passages override quiz-level passages (line 87)
  3. IP Storage Format: IPs stored with dashes replacing dots for Firebase compatibility (lines
  66, 74)
  4. Responsive Breakpoint: 768px triggers layout change (line 38)
  5. Minimal Student Exposure: Teacher sees passages and materials; students only see what's
  needed to answer
  6. Real-time Updates: All changes to Firebase immediately reflected for all connected users

  This comprehensive layout ensures teachers have full control over quiz flow, player
  management, and can monitor student engagement in real-time while maintaining a clean,
  organized interface.

  ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES - BLOCKING FUNCTIONALITY

  1. Missing MultipleChoiceView Component

  Status: ❌ CRITICAL - BROKEN

  Location: QuestionRenderer.jsx:7
  const MultipleChoiceView = ({ question }) => <div>Multiple Choice View</div>;

  Problem:
  - Placeholder component only displays text "Multiple Choice View"
  - Actual MultipleChoiceView.jsx file doesn't exist
  - Multiple-choice questions don't render properly on teacher screen

  PRD Violation: FR-2.4 - "Displays the full question, passage/map/diagram, and full-text answer
   choices"

  Impact: Teachers cannot see multiple-choice questions or options

  ---
  ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

  2. TeacherControlPanel - Non-functional Kick Button

  Status: ⚠️ PRD Deviation

  Location: TeacherControlPanel.jsx:12
  <SoundButton color="red">Kick Player</SoundButton>

  Problem:
  - Button exists but has no onClick handler
  - Kick functionality IS implemented via individual player buttons (TeacherQuizPage.jsx:241)
  - Just not in the control panel as PRD specifies

  PRD Requirement: FR-2.4 - "Includes a Teacher Control Panel with 'Pause', 'Next Question', and
   'Kick Player' buttons"

  Workaround: Teachers can kick players from the Players list section

  ---
  3. RocketRaceChart - Doesn't Match PRD Vision

  Status: ⚠️ Functional but Not to Spec

  Location: RocketRaceChart.jsx:1-23

  Current Implementation: Simple bar chart using recharts library

  PRD Vision:
  - FR-2.4: "Displays the 'Rocket Race' marathon chart, showing player rockets advancing or
  stalling"
  - Design Section 6: "The 'Rocket Race' chart should be a dynamic, engaging animation with a
  space theme"

  Gap:
  - No rocket imagery or space theme
  - No animation of rockets "advancing or stalling"
  - Static bar chart vs dynamic marathon visualization

  Impact: Works correctly for leaderboard functionality but lacks intended visual engagement

  ---
  4. Missing Diagram-Labeling Answer Aggregation

  Status: ⚠️ Feature Gap

  Location: AnswerAggregationDisplay.jsx:274-292

  Problem: Switch statement doesn't include 'diagram-labeling' case
  switch (question.type) {
    case 'multiple-choice': return renderMultipleChoice();
    case 'multiple-select': return renderMultipleSelect();
    case 'completion': return renderCompletion();
    case 'matching': return renderMatching();
    default: return "Answer aggregation not supported for this question type";
  }

  Impact: Teachers see "Answer aggregation not supported" for diagram-labeling questions instead
   of student answer counts

  ---
  5. Results Page - Not "Phenomenal"

  Status: ⚠️ Basic Implementation

  Location: TeacherResultsPage.jsx:26-59

  Current: Confetti + basic table

  PRD Requirement: FR-2.7
  - "A visually 'phenomenal' and celebratory screen"
  - "May include animations, confetti, and a clear winner announcement"

  Missing:
  - Winner spotlight/announcement
  - Additional animations beyond confetti
  - Visual polish (podium, trophy, fanfare, etc.)

  Impact: Functional but lacks "wow factor" specified in PRD

  | Results Page            | ⚠️ 70% (functional but not "phenomenal") |

  Overall PRD Compliance: ~85%

  ---
  🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

  Priority 1 (Critical)

  1. Create MultipleChoiceView component - Display question text and full-text answer options
  for teachers

  Priority 2 (Medium)

  2. Add diagram-labeling aggregation - Show teacher how many students answered each label
  correctly
  3. Connect Kick Player button in TeacherControlPanel or remove it to avoid confusion
  4. Enhance RocketRaceChart - Add rocket icons, animations, space theme per PRD vision

  Priority 3 (Polish)

  5. Enhance TeacherResultsPage - Add winner announcement, podium display, additional animations

  ---
  ✅ CONCLUSION

  The TeacherQuizPage core functionality is solid with excellent implementation of:
  - Responsive two-column layout
  - Real-time Firebase sync
  - Teacher controls (pause, navigate, kick/ban)
  - Answer aggregation for most question types
  - Passage rendering with all media types

  However, there are critical gaps (missing MultipleChoiceView) and design deviations
  (RocketRaceChart, Results page) that prevent full PRD compliance. The application works well
  for most use cases but needs polish to match the envisioned user experience.

● Looking at the PRD compliance issues I found, let me cross-reference them with the Phase 2
  Enhancement Roadmap and Task List to determine priority:

  🚨 PRIORITY ORDERING OF PRD MISMATCHES

  ---
  P0 - CRITICAL & NOT IN ROADMAP 🔴

  1. Missing MultipleChoiceView Component

  Status: ❌ BLOCKING - NOT PLANNED IN PHASE 2

  Why Critical:
  - Multiple-choice is the most basic question type
  - Teachers cannot see question text or options on their screen
  - This is an MVP gap, not a Phase 2 enhancement
  - Currently shows placeholder text: "Multiple Choice View"

  Impact:
  - All multiple-choice questions are broken on teacher view
  - Severely limits app usability

  Phase 2 Status:
  - ❌ NOT in Phase 2 Enhancement Roadmap
  - ❌ NOT in Phase 2 Task List
  - This should have been completed in Phase 1 (MVP)

  Recommendation: FIX IMMEDIATELY before continuing Phase 2 work

  ---
  P1 - HIGH PRIORITY (Planned in Phase 2) 🟡

  2. Missing Diagram-Labeling Answer Aggregation

  Status: ⚠️ Feature Gap - Planned for Sprint 3

  Phase 2 Status:
  - ✅ IS in Phase 2 Roadmap - Story 1.4 (P2 Priority)
  - ✅ IS in Task List - Task 8 (Week 5-6, Sprint 3)
  - Estimated: 13 story points, 2 weeks

  Current Implementation:
  - Diagram-labeling questions work for students
  - Teacher sees "Answer aggregation not supported for this question type"

  Recommendation:
  - Continue as planned in Task 8
  - Add answer aggregation as subtask 8.9 when implementing

  ---
  P2 - MEDIUM PRIORITY (Planned in Phase 2) 🟠

  3. RocketRaceChart - Not Space-Themed

  Status: ⚠️ Design Enhancement - Planned for Sprint 4

  Current Implementation:
  - Simple bar chart using Recharts
  - Fully functional for showing scores
  - Missing: rockets, space theme, animations

  Phase 2 Status:
  - ✅ IS in Phase 2 Roadmap - Story 4.1 (P2 Priority, Week 7-8)
  - ✅ IS in Task List - Task 11 (Sprint 4)
  - Estimated: 8 story points, 1 week

  PRD Requirement:
  - "Dynamic, engaging animation with a space theme"
  - "Player rockets advancing or stalling"

  Recommendation:
  - Continue as planned in Sprint 4
  - This is an expected enhancement, not a bug

  ---
  P3 - LOW PRIORITY (Planned in Phase 2) 🟢

  4. Results Page - Not "Phenomenal"

  Status: ⚠️ Polish Enhancement - Planned for Sprint 4

  Current Implementation:
  - Confetti animation present ✓
  - Basic ranked table ✓
  - Return buttons ✓
  - Missing: Winner announcement, podium, additional animations

  Phase 2 Status:
  - ✅ IS in Phase 2 Roadmap - Story 4.2 (P3 Priority)
  - ⚠️ NOT explicitly in Task List (implied with Task 11)

  PRD Requirement:
  - "Visually 'phenomenal' and celebratory screen"
  - "Winner announcement"

  Recommendation:
  - Add as Task 12.5 (UAT polish) or create Task 13
  - Low priority - current implementation meets functional requirements

  ---
  P4 - MINOR ISSUE (Not in Roadmap) ⚪

  5. TeacherControlPanel - Non-functional Kick Button

  Status: ⚠️ UI Inconsistency - Has Workaround

  Current Implementation:
  - Kick button exists in TeacherControlPanel but has no onClick
  - Kick functionality WORKS via individual player list buttons
  - PRD states: "Teacher Control Panel with 'Pause', 'Next Question', and 'Kick Player' buttons"

  Phase 2 Status:
  - ❌ NOT in Phase 2 Roadmap
  - ❌ NOT in Task List

  Options:
  1. Remove button from TeacherControlPanel (PRD deviation accepted)
  2. Connect button to open player selection modal
  3. Keep as-is (workaround exists)

  Recommendation:
  - Low priority - functional workaround exists
  - Consider removing button to reduce confusion
  - Or add as quick fix: 5 minutes to remove or connect

  🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

  Immediate (Before continuing Phase 2)

  1. ✅ Create MultipleChoiceView.jsx component
    - Display question text and full options for teacher
    - Match style of MultipleSelectView
    - Estimated: 30 minutes

  Sprint 3 (Task 8)

  2. Add diagram-labeling answer aggregation as subtask 8.9

  Sprint 4 (Task 11-12)

  3. Space-themed Rocket Race (already planned)
  4. Enhanced Results Page (add to UAT polish)

  Optional Quick Fixes

  5. Remove or connect Kick Player button in TeacherControlPanel (5 min)

  ---
  🔍 KEY FINDING

  The most critical discovery is that MultipleChoiceView is missing entirely - this represents a
   Phase 1 (MVP) gap, not a Phase 2 enhancement. This should be fixed immediately as it blocks
  the most basic question type functionality for teachers.

  All other issues are either:
  - Already planned in Phase 2 roadmap (Items 2-4)
  - Minor UI inconsistencies with workarounds (Item 5)

  Would you like me to create the MultipleChoiceView component now to fix the P0 critical issue?

> Fix all of what is not already included in the future plan, make notes for what's in the 
future plan but we have already been on development. 

● I'll fix all issues NOT in the future plan, and document what's already been developed. Let me
   start by creating a todo list.

● Let me start by creating the MultipleChoiceView component:

● Write(src\components\questions\MultipleChoiceView.jsx)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to src\components\questions\MultipleChoiceView.jsx        
     import React from 'react';
     import { Stack, Text, Paper } from '@mantine/core';
     import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
     /**
      * MultipleChoiceView Component
      *
      * Displays a multiple-choice question on the teacher screen.
      * Shows the full question text and all answer options.
      * This is for teacher display only - students see simplified interface.

● Now let me update QuestionRenderer to use the actual component:

● Update(src\components\QuestionRenderer.jsx)
  ⎿  Updated src\components\QuestionRenderer.jsx with 1 addition and 2 removals           
        1    import React from 'react';
        2 +  import MultipleChoiceView from './questions/MultipleChoiceView';
        3    import MultipleSelectView from './questions/MultipleSelectView';
        4    import CompletionView from './questions/CompletionView';
        5    import MatchingView from './questions/MatchingView';
        6    import DiagramLabelingView from './questions/DiagramLabelingView';
        7    
        8 -  const MultipleChoiceView = ({ question }) => <div>Multiple Choice View</div>;
