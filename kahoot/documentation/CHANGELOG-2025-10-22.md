## New Features

### 1. Student Quiz Interface Redesign

**Summary:** Complete overhaul of the student quiz interface with Kahoot-style interactive elements.

**Components Added:**
- `src/components/StudentAnswerInput.jsx` - New unified answer input component

**Key Features:**

#### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
- **2 options:** Two full-width rows
- **3 options:** Three quadrants (third spans full width)
- **4 options:** Four quadrants (2x2 grid) with distinct colors:
  - Red (top-left): `#e74c3c`
  - Blue (top-right): `#3498db`
  - Orange (bottom-left): `#f39c12`
  - Green (bottom-right): `#2ecc71`
- **5+ options:** Responsive grid layout with 8 colors
- **Selection:** Click to select, auto-highlights in green
- **No submit button:** Last selection auto-submits on timer end

#### Multiple Select Questions
- Grid layout with colorful buttons
- Toggle selection with visual checkmarks
- Auto-submits array of selected answers on timer end

#### Matching Questions
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Two columns: Items (left, blue) and Answers (right, orange)
- Visual feedback for matched pairs
- Instruction banner on teacher view: "üì± Students: Drag and drop items on your device to match pairs"
- Auto-submits matches on timer end

#### Completion Questions

**User Experience:**
1. Student sees question on teacher's projection
2. Student sees answer choices on their device
3. Student taps/clicks an answer (highlighted in green)
4. Student can change answer by tapping another option
5. Timer counts down in center of screen

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Session Management - Player Counter Showing 0

**Issue:** After clicking "End Session", the player counter showed 0 even though students remained in the waiting room.

**Root Cause:** Session-ending handlers were setting `players: null`, removing all player data.

**Fix:** Modified all session-ending handlers to keep players but reset their scores and answers:

```javascript
// Before
update(gameSessionRef, {
  status: 'waiting',
  players: null,  // ‚ùå Removed all players
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
});

// After
const resetPlayers = {};
if (gameSession?.players) {
  Object.keys(gameSession.players).forEach(playerId => {
    resetPlayers[playerId] = {
      name: gameSession.players[playerId].name,
      ip: gameSession.players[playerId].ip || 'unknown',
      score: 0,
      answers: {}
    };
  });
}

update(gameSessionRef, {
  status: 'waiting',
  players: resetPlayers,  // ‚úÖ Keep players with reset data
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
  isPaused: false
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/TeacherQuizPage.jsx` - `handleBack()`, `handleEndSession()`
- `src/pages/TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx` - `handleBack()`, `handleEndSession()`
- `src/pages/TeacherResultsPage.jsx` - `handleReturnToLobby()`

**Impact:** Players now persist across session resets, maintaining correct player count.

### 2. Student View Blank Page on Second Question

**Issue:** Students got a blank page when the second question loaded, with error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1761097976206-cuawz3sta')
at submitAnswer (StudentQuizPage.jsx:79:39)
```

**Root Cause:** The `submitAnswer` function tried to access `gameSession.players[playerId]` without checking if the players object or specific player exists.

**Fix:** Added safety checks before accessing player data:

```javascript
const submitAnswer = (answer) => {
  if (hasSubmittedRef.current || !gameSession || !quiz) return;

  const playerId = sessionStorage.getItem('playerId');
  
  // ‚úÖ Check if players object exists and player is still in the session
  if (!gameSession.players || !gameSession.players[playerId]) {
    console.warn('Player not found in session, skipping answer submission');
    hasSubmittedRef.current = true;
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of submission logic
};
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/StudentQuizPage.jsx` - `submitAnswer()`

**Impact:** Students can now complete all questions without crashes.

### 3. Incorrect Fastest/Slowest Response Times

**Issue:** The "Fastest Correct" and "Slowest Response" statistics on the Teacher Feedback Page were showing incorrect values or not working at all.

**Root Cause:** The `timeSpent` field was not being saved when students submitted answers. The answer object only contained `{ answer, isCorrect, score }` but the feedback page was trying to access `answer.timeSpent`.

**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive time tracking:

**Step 1: Track elapsed time**
```javascript
const [timeSpent, setTimeSpent] = useState(0);
const questionStartTimeRef = useRef(null);

// Start timer when question loads
useEffect(() => {
  if (gameSession) {
    const newQuestionIndex = gameSession.currentQuestionIndex || 0;
    if (currentQuestionIndexRef.current !== newQuestionIndex) {
      questionStartTimeRef.current = Date.now();  // ‚úÖ Record start time
    }
  }
}, [gameSession]);

// Update elapsed time continuously
useEffect(() => {
  if (!gameSession || gameSession.isPaused || hasSubmittedRef.current) return;

  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (questionStartTimeRef.current) {
      const elapsed = (Date.now() - questionStartTimeRef.current) / 1000;
      setTimeSpent(elapsed);
    }
  }, 100); // Update every 100ms for accuracy

  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [gameSession, hasSubmittedRef.current]);
```

**Step 2: Save time with answer**
```javascript
const submitAnswer = (answer) => {
  // ... validation code ...
  
  // ‚úÖ Calculate time spent
  const finalTimeSpent = questionStartTimeRef.current 
    ? (Date.now() - questionStartTimeRef.current) / 1000 
    : 0;
  
  update(playerRef, {
    score: (currentPlayer?.score || 0) + score,
    answers: {
      ...(currentPlayer?.answers || {}),
      [currentQuestionIndex]: { 
        answer, 
        isCorrect, 
        score,
        timeSpent: finalTimeSpent  // ‚úÖ Now included!
      },
    },
  });
};
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/StudentQuizPage.jsx` - Added time tracking

**Impact:** Feedback page now accurately shows fastest and slowest response times.

**Display Format:**
- Fastest Correct: "‚ö° Fastest Correct - John Doe - 2.3s"
- Slowest Response: "üêå Slowest Response - Jane Smith - 15.7s"
- No Answer: "üêå No Answer - Bob Johnson"

## Database Schema Changes

### Answer Object Schema Update

**Before:**
```javascript
game_sessions/
  {sessionId}/
    players/
      {playerId}/
        answers/
          {questionIndex}/
            answer: <value>
            isCorrect: <boolean>
            score: <number>
```

**After:**
```javascript
game_sessions/
  {sessionId}/
    players/
      {playerId}/
        answers/
          {questionIndex}/
            answer: <value>
            isCorrect: <boolean>
            score: <number>
            timeSpent: <number>  // NEW: Time in seconds
```

**Migration:** No migration needed. Existing answers without `timeSpent` will default to 0 in calculations.

---

## Breaking Changes

### None

All changes are backward compatible. Existing game sessions and answer data will continue to work.

**Compatibility Notes:**
- Old answer objects without `timeSpent` will show as 0 seconds in feedback
- New answer objects will include accurate timing data
- Player data structure remains the same (name, ip, score, answers)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

No code changes required in existing implementations. The new components are drop-in replacements.

### For Users

No action required. All changes are transparent to end users.

### For Existing Data

No database migration needed. The system handles missing `timeSpent` fields gracefully with fallback to 0.
