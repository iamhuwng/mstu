# Debug Logging System Disabled - October 24, 2025

## Purpose
Completely disable the debug logging system to test if it's still causing drawing performance issues despite the optimizations applied in 0012.

## Changes Made

### 1. **App.jsx**
- Commented out `LogProvider` import
- Removed `<LogProvider>` wrapper from all routes
- All pages now run without the logging context

### 2. **All Pages Using Logging**
Disabled `useLog` in the following files:
- `TeacherQuizPage.jsx`
- `TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx`
- `TeacherResultsPage.jsx`
- `StudentQuizPageNew.jsx`
- `PassageRenderer.jsx`

**Pattern applied:**
```javascript
// Before:
import { useLog } from '../context/LogContext';
const { addLog } = useLog();

// After:
// import { useLog } from '../context/LogContext'; // DISABLED FOR TESTING
const addLog = () => {}; // No-op function
```

### 3. **LogContext.jsx**
- Left intact (not imported anywhere, so not loaded)
- Can be re-enabled easily by uncommenting imports

## Testing Instructions

1. Visit **https://kahut1.web.app**
2. Start a quiz session with drawing enabled
3. Test drawing performance:
   - Draw multiple strokes rapidly
   - Check for lag or delay
   - Verify full strokes are captured
   - Test with different pen pressures

## Expected Outcomes

### If Drawing Works Perfectly:
- Debug logging system was still causing issues despite optimizations
- Consider permanent removal or complete rewrite using Web Workers

### If Drawing Still Lags:
- Issue is elsewhere (pointer events, canvas rendering, React re-renders)
- Need to investigate other performance bottlenecks
- Re-enable logging for debugging

## Rollback Instructions

To re-enable debug logging:

1. **App.jsx** - Uncomment LogProvider import and wrap routes
2. **All pages** - Uncomment `useLog` imports and remove no-op functions
3. Rebuild and deploy

## Bundle Size Impact

**Before (with logging):**
- `index-QSgJC1cq.js`: 214.04 kB (67.52 kB gzipped)

**After (without logging):**
- `index-Clw4l7Ka.js`: 209.66 kB (66.31 kB gzipped)

**Savings:** ~4.4 KB raw, ~1.2 KB gzipped

## Notes

- All `addLog()` calls still exist in code but are no-ops
- No console errors or warnings
- Debug panel UI completely removed from DOM
- SessionStorage no longer used for logs
