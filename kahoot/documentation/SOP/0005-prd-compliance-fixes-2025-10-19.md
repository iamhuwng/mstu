## 1. P0 - Critical Issue Resolved: Missing MultipleChoiceView

*   **Problem:** The `MultipleChoiceView` component was a placeholder and did not render multiple-choice questions on the teacher's screen.
*   **Fix:** Created the `MultipleChoiceView.jsx` component to correctly display the question text and options. Updated the `QuestionRenderer.jsx` to use the new component.
*   **Impact:** All question types are now visible to the teacher.

## 2. P1 - High Priority Issue Addressed: Missing Diagram-Labeling Answer Aggregation

*   **Problem:** The `AnswerAggregationDisplay` component did not support `diagram-labeling` questions.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Created the `aggregateDiagramLabeling` function in `src/utils/answerAggregation.js` to calculate statistics for diagram labeling questions.
    *   Added a new `renderDiagramLabeling` function to the `AnswerAggregationDisplay` component to display the statistics.
    *   Updated the `AnswerAggregationDisplay` switch statement to include the `diagram-labeling` case.
*   **Impact:** Teachers can now see aggregated results for diagram labeling questions.

## 3. P4 - Minor Issue Resolved: Non-functional Kick Button

*   **Problem:** The "Kick Player" button in the `TeacherControlPanel` was not functional.
*   **Fix:** Removed the non-functional button from the `TeacherControlPanel` and added a note to the UI to clarify that kicking is done from the player list.
*   **Impact:** Reduced UI confusion and potential user frustration.
