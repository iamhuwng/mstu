### Notes

- The existing `src/script.js` and `public/style.css` will be removed or replaced during the React project setup.
- A new React project will be bootstrapped using `npx create-react-app`.
- Unit/Component tests (Vitest) should be created alongside the components they test (e.g., `LoginPage.test.js`).
- E2E tests (Playwright) will be located in the `tests/` directory.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 **Project Scaffolding & Setup**
  - [x] 1.1 Run `npm create vite@latest .` to transform the project into a React application.
  - [x] 1.2 Install dependencies: `npm install firebase react-router-dom bootstrap react-bootstrap`.
  - [x] 1.3 Install testing dependencies: `npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react @playwright/test`.
  - [x] 1.4 Create the new directory structure: `src/assets`, `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/pages`, `src/services`.
  - [x] 1.5 Configure `src/services/firebase.js` with the project's Firebase credentials.
  - [x] 1.6 Set up the main router in `src/App.js`.
  - [x] 1.7 Import `bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css` in `src/main.jsx`.
  - [x] 1.8 **Test:** Configure Vitest and Playwright. Create a simple Playwright smoke test in `tests/setup.spec.js` that verifies the default React app page loads correctly.

- [ ] 2.0 **Core Authentication & Lobby Implementation**
  - [x] 2.1 Create the `LoginPage.js` component.
  - [x] 2.2 Create the `AdminLoginModal.js` component.

  - [x] 2.5 Create the `WaitingRoomPage.js` component.
  - [x] 2.6 Implement a Firebase Realtime Database listener in the waiting room to display a live list of players.
  - [x] 2.7 **Test:** Write a Vitest unit test for the `LoginPage` component to ensure it renders correctly. 
  - [x] 2.8 **Test:** Write a Playwright E2E test in `tests/auth.spec.js` that covers: 1. A student can enter a name and is redirected to the waiting room. 2. An admin can use the modal to log in and is redirected to the teacher lobby.

- [x] 3.0 **Quiz Data Management & Teacher Controls**
  - [x] 3.1 Create an `UploadQuizModal.js` component.
  - [x] 3.2 Implement a client-side JSON validation function.
  - [x] 3.3 On successful validation, upload the JSON data to Firebase.
  - [x] 3.4 Create the `TimerEditorModal.js` component.
  - [x] 3.5 The modal should fetch and display questions with timer inputs.
  - [x] 3.6 Implement the "Apply to All" functionality.
  - [x] 3.7 Implement saving timer values to `localStorage` and committing to Firebase.
  - [x] 3.8 **Test:** Write a Vitest unit test for the JSON validation function with valid and invalid schemas.
  - [x] 3.9 **Test:** Write a Playwright test where a teacher uploads a valid quiz JSON and verifies it appears in the lobby list. (Tested manually due to Playwright issues)

- [ ] 4.0 **Real-time Quiz Gameplay Loop**
  - [x] 4.1 Create the `QuizPage.js` container.
