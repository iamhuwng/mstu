  - If no: navigate to next question
- [x] 4.3.6: Cleanup timer on component unmount

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx` ✅ (already implemented in Task 4.1)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Auto-advance logic fully implemented in TeacherFeedbackPage
- `useEffect` hook manages both countdown interval (1000ms) and advance timeout (5000ms)
- `setInterval` updates countdown state every second for visual feedback
- `setTimeout` triggers `handleAutoAdvance` after 5 seconds
- Progress bar uses countdown value: `(countdown / 5) * 100`
- Progress bar color changes dynamically: blue (5-4s) → yellow (3s) → red (2-0s)
- `handleNextQuestion` clears both timers and calls `handleAutoAdvance` immediately
- `handleAutoAdvance` checks if last question: navigates to `/teacher-results/${gameSessionId}` or increments index and navigates to `/teacher-quiz/${gameSessionId}`
- Cleanup in useEffect return: clears both `timeoutRef` and `intervalRef`
- Proper timer cleanup on unmount prevents memory leaks
- All 213 tests passing ✅

**Technical Note:** Similar to StudentFeedbackPage auto-advance (already implemented in Task 5 of Phase 2).

- [x] 4.4.6: Test final question → feedback → results flow

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.jsx` ✅ Modified (added TeacherFeedbackPage route)
- `src/pages/TeacherQuizPage.jsx` ✅ Modified (added onTimeUp callback, updated handleNextQuestion)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added lazy import for TeacherFeedbackPage in App.jsx
- Added route: `/teacher-feedback/:gameSessionId` (with PrivateRoute protection)
- Added `handleTimeUp` function in TeacherQuizPage: navigates to feedback page when timer expires
- Updated `handleNextQuestion` function: navigates to feedback page instead of incrementing index directly
- Added `onTimeUp={handleTimeUp}` prop to TimerDisplay component
- Navigation flow implemented:
  1. TeacherQuizPage → (timer expires OR Next clicked) → TeacherFeedbackPage
  2. TeacherFeedbackPage → (auto-advance after 5s OR Next clicked) → TeacherQuizPage (next question) OR TeacherResultsPage (if last question)
- Firebase `currentPhase` field not required - navigation state managed via routing
- All 213 tests passing ✅

**Technical Notes:**
- TimerDisplay already had `onTimeUp` callback support
- TeacherFeedbackPage handles incrementing currentQuestionIndex on auto-advance
- Students automatically follow teacher's navigation via Firebase listeners

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)
1. **Task 1** - Layout restructure is foundation for all other UI changes
2. **Task 2** - Footer bar required before implementing player/ban panels
3. **Task 4** - Feedback screen required before removing answer aggregation
4. **Task 5** - Must complete AFTER Task 4 (moves aggregation to feedback)
5. **Task 6-7** - Player/ban functionality can be done in parallel after Task 2

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Task 8** (Admin persistence) can be developed independently
- **Task 9** (Bug fix) can be developed independently
- **Task 10** (Answer display) can be done anytime before Task 4
- **Task 6 & 7** (Player management + Ban list) can be done in parallel

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk:** Draggable divider implementation - may require fallback to simpler solution
  - **Update (2025-10-20):** Risk reduced to LOW. Research completed, react-resizable-panels selected as optimal solution.
- **Medium Risk:** IP capture - may need fallback if third-party API fails
- **Medium Risk:** Previous Question navigation - complex state management, test thoroughly

---

## Implementation Research & Decisions

### Draggable Divider Library Selection (Task 1.3.1 - Completed 2025-10-20)

**Research Question:** Which library should be used for implementing the draggable divider between passage panel and question area?

**Libraries Evaluated:**

1. **react-resizable-panels** ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - **Status:** Actively maintained (last updated 18 days ago)
   - **Use Case:** Designed specifically for panel layouts (exact match for our requirement)
   - **API:** Simple - PanelGroup, Panel, PanelResizeHandle
   - **Features:** Mouse, touch, keyboard input support; built-in state management
   - **Adoption:** 1,140 projects using it
   - **Bundle Size:** ~15 KB
   - **Pros:**
     - Perfect fit for side-by-side resizable panels
     - Modern, well-maintained codebase
     - Clean integration with React components
     - Supports percentage-based constraints (20%-80% requirement)
   - **Cons:**
     - Has auto-save feature (must disable with `autoSaveId={null}` per PRD FR-4.1.5)
     - Only supports percentage-based constraints (not pixel-based, but this is acceptable)

2. **react-resizable** ⚠️ Already Installed but Removed
   - **Status:** Last updated 3 years ago (not actively maintained)
   - **Use Case:** Designed for individual component resizing, not panel layouts
   - **Adoption:** 1,159 projects
   - **Decision:** Already removed in Task 1.1, not suitable for our use case

3. **re-resizable**
   - **Status:** Actively maintained, TypeScript support
   - **Use Case:** Individual component resizing (not panel layouts)
   - **Decision:** More complex API for our specific use case

**Final Decision:** react-resizable-panels

**Rationale:**
1. **Perfect Alignment:** Designed exactly for resizable panel layouts (our exact requirement)
2. **Modern & Maintained:** Active development, updated recently
3. **PRD Compliance:** Can implement all requirements:
   - 50/50 default split (per Q4 resolution)
   - Min/max constraints 20%-80% (per FR-4.1.7)
   - Reset on question change (disable auto-save)
   - Clean visual divider with col-resize cursor
4. **Clean Integration:** Will work seamlessly with existing CollapsiblePassagePanel component

**Implementation Approach:**
```jsx
import { Panel, PanelGroup, PanelResizeHandle } from 'react-resizable-panels';

// In CollapsiblePassagePanel.jsx:
<PanelGroup direction="horizontal" autoSaveId={null}>
  <Panel defaultSize={50} minSize={20} maxSize={80}>
    {/* Passage content */}
  </Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel defaultSize={50}>
    {/* Question area */}
  </Panel>
</PanelGroup>
```

**Key Configuration:**
- `autoSaveId={null}` - Disables persistence (per PRD FR-4.1.5)
- `defaultSize={50}` - 50/50 split (per Q4 resolution)
- `minSize={20}` / `maxSize={80}` - Constraints (per FR-4.1.7)
- Reset on question change via `useEffect` watching `currentQuestionIndex`

**Next Steps:**
1. Install: `npm install react-resizable-panels` (Task 1.3.2)
2. Integrate PanelGroup into CollapsiblePassagePanel (Task 1.3.3-1.3.6)
3. Test constraints and reset behavior (Task 1.3.7-1.3.8)

**Session Notes:**
- User requested research for Task 1.3.1 only (incremental approach)
- Web search performed on 2025-10-20
- API error encountered at end of session (insufficient credits) - did not affect research completion
- All tests passed (193/193) prior to research phase

**Implementation Completed (2025-10-20):**
- Task 1.3.2-1.3.8 completed in single session
- Library installed successfully with no vulnerabilities
- CollapsiblePassagePanel completely refactored:
  - Changed from fixed overlay to resizable panel layout
  - Now accepts `children` prop for question content
  - Three rendering modes:
    1. No passage: render children directly
    2. Passage exists, closed: show hamburger button + full-width children
    3. Passage exists, open: show PanelGroup with resizable panels
- PanelGroup configuration:
  - `direction="horizontal"`
  - `autoSaveId={null}` - disables persistence per PRD FR-4.1.5
  - Left Panel: `defaultSize={50}` `minSize={20}` `maxSize={80}`
  - Right Panel: `defaultSize={50}` (no size constraints)
  - PanelResizeHandle: 4px width, #e0e0e0 bg, col-resize cursor, hover effect
- Auto-reset behavior: `useEffect` watches `passage` prop, resets `isOpen` to false on change
- TeacherQuizPage integration: question content wrapped as children of CollapsiblePassagePanel
- All 193 tests passing ✅ (verified post-implementation)
