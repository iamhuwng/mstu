**Task List:** `documentation/tasks/tasks-0004-prd-two-modal-quiz-editor-system.md`

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All tasks from the PRD have been successfully implemented to fix the two-modal quiz editor system.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. QuizEditor.jsx

**Removed:**
- ❌ `Box` component with incorrect `transform: translateX(-25%)`
- ❌ `Group` component with improper alignment
- ❌ Unused imports: `Group`, `Box`

**Added:**
- ✅ Proper flexbox centering structure with two wrapper divs
- ✅ Outer wrapper for vertical centering (100vh height)
- ✅ Inner container for horizontal layout with 1.5rem gap
- ✅ `showEditor` prop passed to `EditQuizModal`
- ✅ Question Editor width set to 650px (larger than Edit Quiz)
- ✅ Smooth opacity transition (0.3s ease) for Question Editor

**New Structure:**
```jsx
<Modal opened={show} size="auto" ...>
  {/* Outer wrapper for vertical centering */}
  <div style={{
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    minHeight: '100vh',
    width: '100%'
  }}>
    {/* Inner container for both modals */}
    <div style={{
      display: 'flex',
      gap: '1.5rem',
      alignItems: 'flex-start'
    }}>
      <EditQuizModal showEditor={showEditor} ... />
      {showEditor && <Paper><QuestionEditorPanel ... /></Paper>}
    </div>
  </div>
</Modal>
```

### 2. EditQuizModal.jsx

**Added:**
- ✅ `showEditor` prop to component signature
- ✅ Dynamic width: `450px` (alone) → `350px` (with editor)
- ✅ Smooth width transition: `transition: 'width 0.3s ease'`

**Updated Paper Component:**
```jsx
<Paper style={{ 
  width: showEditor ? '350px' : '450px', 
  maxHeight: '80vh', 
  display: 'flex', 
  flexDirection: 'column',
  transition: 'width 0.3s ease'
}}>
```

## How It Works

### Before Clicking a Question
1. Edit Quiz dialog appears **centered** on the page
2. Width: **450px**
3. No Question Editor visible

### After Clicking a Question
1. Edit Quiz dialog **shrinks** to **350px** with smooth animation
2. Question Editor **appears** on the right at **650px** width
3. Both modals are **centered together as a pair** on the page
4. Gap between modals: **1.5rem**
5. Smooth **0.3s ease** transitions for all changes

### When Closing Question Editor
1. Question Editor **fades out**
2. Edit Quiz dialog **expands back** to **450px**
3. Edit Quiz dialog remains **centered** on the page
