# Fix: MIME Type Error for JavaScript Modules

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

---

## Error Description

### Console Error
```
TeacherWaitingRoomPage-CRPO6LCL.js:1  
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script 
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". 
Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.

index-C1ybZd2J.js:11  
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: 
https://kahoot.mstu.work/assets/TeacherWaitingRoomPage-CRPO6LCL.js
```

### Symptoms
- Application loads initially
- When navigating to certain routes (like Teacher Waiting Room), the page fails to load
- Browser console shows MIME type errors
- JavaScript module files return HTML instead of JavaScript

---

## Root Cause

### The Problem
Firebase Hosting configuration had a rewrite rule that was catching **ALL requests**, including JavaScript module files in the `/assets/` directory:

```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "**",
    "destination": "/index.html"
  }
]
```

### What Was Happening
1. Browser requests: `https://kahoot.mstu.work/assets/TeacherWaitingRoomPage-CRPO6LCL.js`
2. Firebase rewrite rule catches this request
3. Firebase returns `/index.html` (HTML content) instead of the JavaScript file
4. Browser receives HTML with MIME type `text/html`
5. Browser expects JavaScript with MIME type `application/javascript`
6. **Error:** MIME type mismatch causes module loading to fail

### Why This Happens
- Modern browsers enforce **strict MIME type checking** for ES modules
- If a `.js` file doesn't have the correct `Content-Type` header, the browser refuses to execute it
- This is a security feature to prevent XSS attacks

---

## The Fix

### Updated firebase.json

**Before (Broken):**
```json
{
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "kahut1",
      "public": "dist",
      "ignore": [...],
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "**",
          "destination": "/index.html"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "kahut1",
      "public": "dist",
      "ignore": [...],
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "**/*.@(js|mjs)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Content-Type",
              "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "source": "**/*.css",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Content-Type",
              "value": "text/css; charset=utf-8"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "**",
          "destination": "/index.html"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Changes

1. **Added `headers` section** before `rewrites`
   - Firebase processes headers before rewrites
   - This ensures correct MIME types are set

2. **Explicit MIME type for JavaScript files**
   ```json
   "source": "**/*.@(js|mjs)",
   "Content-Type": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
   ```
   - Matches all `.js` and `.mjs` files
   - Sets correct MIME type
   - Includes charset for completeness

3. **Explicit MIME type for CSS files**
   ```json
   "source": "**/*.css",
   "Content-Type": "text/css; charset=utf-8"
   ```
   - Ensures CSS files also have correct MIME type

## How It Works Now

### Request Flow (Fixed)

```
1. Browser requests: /assets/TeacherWaitingRoomPage-CRPO6LCL.js
   ↓
2. Firebase checks headers configuration
   ↓
3. Matches pattern: **/*.@(js|mjs)
   ↓
4. Sets header: Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8
   ↓
5. Serves the actual JavaScript file with correct MIME type
   ↓
6. Browser receives JavaScript with correct MIME type
   ↓
7. Module loads successfully ✅
```

### Why Headers Come Before Rewrites

Firebase Hosting processes configuration in this order:
1. **Headers** - Set response headers
2. **Redirects** - HTTP redirects
3. **Rewrites** - URL rewrites (SPA routing)

By placing headers first, we ensure that:
- Asset files get correct MIME types
- Rewrite rules still work for SPA routing
- Only HTML pages get rewritten to `/index.html`

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Navigate to Teacher Waiting Room → Error
- ❌ Console shows MIME type error
- ❌ JavaScript modules fail to load
- ❌ Page shows blank or error

### After Fix
- ✅ Navigate to Teacher Waiting Room → Success
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ JavaScript modules load correctly
- ✅ Page renders properly

### Test Checklist
- ✅ Home page loads
- ✅ Login page works

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Firebase
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting:kahut1
```

### 3. Verify Fix
1. Open browser
2. Navigate to: https://kahoot.mstu.work
3. Go to Teacher Waiting Room
4. Check console for errors
5. Verify page loads correctly

### 4. Clear Browser Cache (If Needed)
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
- Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache manually

## Why This Error Occurs in SPAs

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- React, Vue, Angular apps use client-side routing
- All routes should return `index.html` for the SPA to handle
- This is achieved with the rewrite rule: `** → /index.html`

### The Challenge
- Need to rewrite HTML routes to `index.html`
- But NOT rewrite asset files (JS, CSS, images)
- Firebase's rewrite rule `**` catches everything

### The Solution
- Use **headers** to set correct MIME types BEFORE rewrites
- Firebase serves actual files with correct headers
- Rewrite rule only affects routes that don't match actual files

## Related Issues

### Issue #1: Asset Files in Subdirectories
**Problem:** Assets in `/assets/` folder getting rewritten  
**Solution:** Headers configuration ensures correct MIME types

### Issue #2: CSS Files Not Loading
**Problem:** CSS files might have same issue  
**Solution:** Added explicit header for `.css` files

### Issue #3: Future Asset Types
**Problem:** Images, fonts, etc. might need headers  
**Solution:** Can add more header rules as needed:
```json
{
  "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp)",
  "headers": [{"key": "Content-Type", "value": "image/*"}]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Firebase Hosting Configuration

1. **Always set explicit MIME types** for asset files
2. **Place headers before rewrites** in configuration
3. **Use glob patterns** to match file types: `**/*.@(js|mjs)`
4. **Include charset** for text-based files: `charset=utf-8`
5. **Test after deployment** to verify headers are working

### SPA Routing

1. **Keep rewrite rule simple**: `** → /index.html`
2. **Let headers handle MIME types**
3. **Don't try to exclude assets from rewrites** (complicated and error-prone)
4. **Trust Firebase to serve actual files** when they exist

## Prevention

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Check `firebase.json` configuration
- [ ] Verify headers are set for asset files
- [ ] Test deployment before pushing to production
- [ ] Check browser console for MIME type errors

### Monitoring
- Watch for console errors in production
- Monitor Firebase Hosting logs
- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Test all routes after deployment

## Conclusion

### Summary
Fixed critical MIME type error by adding explicit `Content-Type` headers for JavaScript and CSS files in Firebase Hosting configuration. The headers are processed before rewrites, ensuring asset files are served with correct MIME types.

### Key Takeaway
When deploying SPAs to Firebase Hosting:
1. Use rewrite rules for SPA routing
2. Add explicit headers for asset files
3. Place headers before rewrites in configuration
4. Test thoroughly after deployment

### Impact
- ✅ All routes now load correctly
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ JavaScript modules load properly
- ✅ Application fully functional
