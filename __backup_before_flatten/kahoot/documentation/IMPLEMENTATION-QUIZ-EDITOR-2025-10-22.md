# Quiz Question Editor Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Feature:** Comprehensive Quiz Question Editor  
**PRD Reference:** `documentation/tasks/0007-prd-quiz-question-editor.md`

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive quiz editing system that allows teachers to edit all aspects of quiz questions directly from the Teacher Lobby, replacing the previous timer-only editing functionality.

## Components Created

### 1. EditQuizModal.jsx
**Location:** `src/components/EditQuizModal.jsx`

**Key Features:**
- Resizable left panel (300px - 600px) showing question list
- Right panel that slides in when a question is selected
- Auto-save to localStorage with unique key per quiz
- Validation system with warnings and popups
- Modified question indicators (orange dot)
- Visual selection highlighting
- Dual-dialog layout with draggable divider

**State Management:**
- `selectedQuestionIndex` - Currently selected question for editing
- `leftPanelWidth` - Width of resizable left panel
- `editedQuestions` - Object containing all edited question data
- `modifiedQuestions` - Set tracking which questions have been modified
- `showValidationPopup` - Controls validation warning popup
- `validationErrors` - Array of validation error messages
- `pendingAction` - Tracks whether user is trying to save or close

**LocalStorage Schema:**
```json
{
  "quiz_edit_<quizId>": {
    "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
    "questions": {
      "0": { "question": "...", "options": [...], "answer": "...", "timer": 10 },
      "1": { ... }
    },
    "modified": [0, 2, 5]
  }
}
```

**Validation Logic:**
- Empty question text detection
- Empty answer option detection
- Missing correct answer detection
- Real-time validation on field change
- Popup on save/close with validation errors
- Options: Continue Editing, Save Anyway, Discard Changes

### 2. QuestionEditorPanel.jsx
**Location:** `src/components/QuestionEditorPanel.jsx`

**Key Features:**
- Full question editing interface
- Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Real-time validation warnings (red borders + warning text)
- Reset to original functionality
- Auto-save on every change
- Visual warning counter in footer
- Close button (X) in header

**Editable Fields:**
- Question text (Textarea)
- Answer options (4 TextInputs for multiple choice)
- Correct answer (Radio group)
- Timer (NumberInput, 5-300 seconds)
- Question type (disabled, read-only)
- Passage (Textarea, if present)

**Navigation:**
- Previous button (disabled on first question)
- Next button (disabled on last question)
- Close button (X) to collapse right panel

## Updates to Existing Components

### TeacherLobbyPage.jsx
**Changes:**
1. Import changed from `EditTimersModal` to `EditQuizModal`
2. Button text changed from "Edit Timers" to "Edit"
3. Button icon changed from timer icon to edit/pencil icon
4. Handler renamed from `handleEditTimers` to `handleEditQuiz`
5. Card description updated to reflect new functionality

**Lines Modified:**
- Line 7: Import statement
- Lines 47-50: Handler function
- Lines 128-139: Button component
- Lines 122-124: Description text
- Lines 299-305: Modal component

## Routing & Data Flow

### Teacher Flow
```
Teacher Lobby Page
    ↓
Click "Edit" button on quiz card
    ↓
EditQuizModal opens (left panel with question list)
    ↓
Click on a question
    ↓
QuestionEditorPanel slides in from right
    ↓
Edit fields (auto-saves to localStorage)
    ↓
Click "Save Changes"
    ↓
Validation check
    ↓
If valid: Save to Firebase → Clear localStorage → Close modal
    ↓
If invalid: Show validation popup with options
```

### Student Flow (Unchanged)
```
Student Waiting Room
    ↓
Teacher starts quiz
    ↓
StudentQuizPage loads quiz from Firebase
    ↓
Displays questions using QuestionRenderer
    ↓
Submits answers to game_sessions/{sessionId}/players/{playerId}
```

### Data Isolation
- **Teacher edits** modify `/quizzes/{quizId}/questions/{index}` in Firebase
- **Student answers** are stored in `/game_sessions/{sessionId}/players/{playerId}/answers`
- **Active sessions** reference quiz by ID, not by embedding quiz data
- **No routing conflicts** - Teacher uses `/lobby`, Students use `/student-quiz/{sessionId}`

## Firebase Data Structure

### Quiz Storage
```
/quizzes/{quizId}/
  ├── title: "Quiz Title"
  ├── questions/
  │   ├── 0/
  │   │   ├── question: "Question text"
  │   │   ├── options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
  │   │   ├── answer: "Correct answer"
  │   │   ├── timer: 10
  │   │   ├── type: "multiple-choice"
  │   │   └── passage: "Optional passage"
  │   ├── 1/ ...
  │   └── 2/ ...
```

### Game Session (Unchanged)
```
/game_sessions/{sessionId}/
  ├── quizId: "quiz123"
  ├── status: "in-progress"
  ├── currentQuestionIndex: 0
  ├── isPaused: false
  ├── players/
  │   └── {playerId}/
  │       ├── name: "Student Name"
  │       ├── score: 100
  │       └── answers/
  │           └── 0/
  │               ├── answer: "Selected answer"
  │               ├── isCorrect: true
  │               ├── score: 50
  │               └── timeSpent: 8.5
```

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Resizable Panel
- Uses mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup)
- Constrained between 300px and 600px
- Visual feedback on hover (purple highlight)
- Smooth dragging experience

### 2. Auto-Save Mechanism
- Triggers on every field change via `useEffect`
- Debounced by React's state batching
- Unique localStorage key per quiz
- Recovers unsaved changes on modal reopen

### 3. Validation System
- Field-level validation (real-time)
- Form-level validation (on save/close)
- Visual indicators:
  - Red borders on invalid fields
  - Warning icons with messages
  - Orange dot on modified questions
  - Warning counter in editor footer

### 4. User Experience
- Click outside does nothing (prevents accidental close)
- Only close button (X) closes right panel
- Cancel/Close buttons trigger validation check if modified
- Confirmation dialog on reset
- Success message on save
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open Edit modal from Teacher Lobby
- [ ] Click on different questions
- [ ] Resize left panel by dragging
- [ ] Edit question text, options, answer, timer
- [ ] Verify auto-save to localStorage (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] Close and reopen modal (should restore unsaved changes)
- [ ] Leave fields empty and try to save (should show validation popup)
- [ ] Click "Save Anyway" with validation errors
- [ ] Click "Discard Changes" when closing with unsaved changes
- [ ] Use Previous/Next buttons to navigate
- [ ] Reset a question to original state
- [ ] Save successfully and verify Firebase update
- [ ] Start a quiz session and verify students see updated questions

### Edge Cases Covered
1. **Empty fields** - Validation warnings displayed
2. **Unsaved changes on close** - Popup with options
3. **Browser refresh** - LocalStorage preserves changes
4. **Concurrent editing** - Each teacher has separate localStorage (not handled at Firebase level)
5. **First/last question navigation** - Buttons disabled appropriately
6. **No questions in quiz** - Handled by existing validation
7. **Missing quiz data** - Null checks throughout

## Student View Impact

### No Breaking Changes
- Students continue to use existing `StudentQuizPage.jsx`
- Questions are loaded from Firebase in real-time
- No changes to answer submission logic
- No changes to scoring or feedback
- Routing remains separate (`/student-quiz/{sessionId}`)

### Verified Compatibility
- Quiz data structure unchanged (same fields)
- Question rendering uses same `QuestionRenderer` component
- Timer functionality preserved
- Answer validation logic unchanged
- Feedback and results pages unaffected

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
1. **Lazy loading** - Modal components only render when opened
2. **Memoization** - Can be added to question list rendering if needed
3. **Debounced auto-save** - React's state batching prevents excessive writes
4. **Conditional rendering** - Right panel only renders when question selected
5. **LocalStorage** - Minimal data stored, cleared on successful save

### Potential Improvements
- Add `React.memo` to question list items if performance issues arise
- Implement debounce on text inputs for very large quizzes
- Add loading states for Firebase operations
- Implement optimistic UI updates

## Security & Data Integrity

### Safeguards
1. **PrivateRoute** - Teacher pages require authentication
2. **Validation** - Prevents saving incomplete questions
3. **Confirmation dialogs** - Prevents accidental data loss
4. **LocalStorage isolation** - Per-quiz storage keys
5. **Firebase rules** - Should enforce teacher-only write access (verify in Firebase console)

### Recommendations
- Implement Firebase security rules to restrict quiz editing to authenticated teachers
- Add audit logging for quiz modifications
- Consider implementing version history for quizzes
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Known Limitations

1. **No concurrent editing protection** - If two teachers edit the same quiz simultaneously, last save wins
2. **No question reordering** - Out of scope per PRD
3. **No add/delete questions** - Out of scope per PRD
4. **No bulk editing** - Out of scope per PRD
5. **No undo history** - Only single-level reset to original
6. **No media upload UI** - Passage field exists but no file upload interface

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features (Not Implemented)
- Add new questions to existing quiz
- Delete questions from quiz
- Reorder questions via drag-and-drop
- Bulk edit multiple questions
- Question bank/template system
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution
- Version history and rollback
- Media/image upload for questions
- Rich text editor for passages
- Question duplication
- Import/export individual questions
