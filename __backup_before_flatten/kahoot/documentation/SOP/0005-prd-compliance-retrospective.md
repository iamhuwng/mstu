## 1. Overview

This document provides a retrospective on the development process of bringing the quiz application into full compliance with the PRD. The work was divided into several tasks, each addressing a specific deviation from the PRD.

## 2. Development Process

The development process was as follows:

1.  **Layout Restructuring:** The teacher quiz page was restructured to have a two-column layout, with questions on the left and passage/material on the right. The Rocket Race chart, Teacher Control Panel, and Players List were moved below the two-column layout. The layout was also made responsive and stacks vertically on smaller screens.

2.  **Passage/Material Display:** A `PassageRenderer` component was created to display passages from the quiz data, with support for text and images. The `comprehensive-mock-quiz.json` file was updated with sample passages.

3.  **Answer Aggregation:** An `AnswerAggregationDisplay` component was created to display aggregated answer counts instead of individual student answers.

4.  **New Question Types:** The following new question types were implemented:
    *   Matching
    *   Typed Completion
    *   Diagram Labeling

5.  **IP Ban Management:** An `IPBanPanel` component was created to allow the teacher to unban players.

6.  **Student View Optimization:** The student view was optimized to be minimal and not show the question text for multiple-choice questions.

## 3. Technical Decisions

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application was developed using a component-based architecture, which allowed for the creation of reusable components for the different question types and UI elements.

*   **JSON Schema:** A JSON schema was defined for each question type to ensure that the quiz data is in the correct format.

*   **Unit Testing:** Unit tests were written for all new components and functions to ensure that they are working correctly.

*   **End-to-End Testing:** An end-to-end test was created to verify the full quiz flow.

## 4. Testing

All new features were tested with unit tests and an end-to-end test. All tests passed successfully.

## 5. Conclusion

The application is now fully compliant with the PRD. All the critical deviations identified in the `0002-prd-deviation-adjustment-plan.md` document have been addressed.
