# Bug Fixes - October 23, 2025

## Summary
Fixed multiple critical issues affecting quiz functionality, student presence tracking, and ban system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Timer Reset on Question Change
**Problem:** Timer on student view did not reset when questions changed (either automatically or through teacher actions like next/previous/resume).

**Root Cause:** The `TimerDisplay` component wasn't remounting when the question changed because React couldn't detect the change.

**Solution:** Added a `key` prop to `TimerDisplay` based on `currentQuestionIndex` to force component remount on question changes.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/StudentQuizPage.jsx`

**Changes:**
```jsx
<TimerDisplay
  key={gameSession.currentQuestionIndex}  // Added this line
  totalTime={currentQuestion.timer}
  isPaused={gameSession.isPaused}
  onTimeUp={handleTimeUp}
  size={200}
/>
```

### 2. ✅ Rocket Race Animation
**Problem:** Rocket race needed to fly from ground up (vertical orientation) and display total points on each rocket.

**Root Cause:** Original implementation was horizontal. Points were displayed below but not on the rockets themselves.

**Solution:** 
- Transformed layout to vertical orientation using flexbox
- Rockets now fly from bottom to top using `bottom` positioning
- Added point display directly on each rocket with proper rotation
- Maintained all animations (trails, flames, leader effects)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/RocketRaceChart.jsx`

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from horizontal tracks to vertical columns
- Rockets positioned with `bottom: ${position}%` instead of `left`
- Rotated rockets 90 degrees: `transform: 'translateX(-50%) rotate(-90deg)'`
- Added inline point display on rockets with counter-rotation

---

### 3. ✅ Fastest Correct and Slowest Response
**Problem:** Need to verify if these features work correctly.

**Status:** ✅ **Working Correctly**

**Verification:** Code in `TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx` (lines 90-113) correctly:
- Finds fastest correct answer by comparing `timeSpent` values
- Prioritizes showing "No Answer" students over slow responders
- Shows slowest responder if everyone answered
- Handles edge cases (no correct answers, no players)

**No changes required.**

---

### 4. ✅ Inactive Students Counted as Active
**Problem:** Students who closed their browser were still counted as active in the lobby and could join new quizzes.

**Root Cause:** Firebase doesn't automatically remove disconnected clients. The app wasn't using Firebase's presence detection system.

**Solution:** Implemented Firebase's `onDisconnect()` API to automatically remove players when they disconnect.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentWaitingRoomPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/StudentQuizPage.jsx`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Set up automatic removal when player disconnects
const playerId = sessionStorage.getItem('playerId');
if (playerId) {
  const playerRef = ref(database, `game_sessions/${gameSessionId}/players/${playerId}`);
  onDisconnect(playerRef).remove();
}
```

**Applied to:**
- Initial join (LoginPage)
- Rejoin logic (LoginPage)
- Waiting room (StudentWaitingRoomPage)
- During quiz (StudentQuizPage)

---

### 5. ✅ Ban System Issues
**Problem:** 
- Teachers received warnings about being unable to find student IP addresses
- Kicked students could rejoin the quiz
- Banned students appeared in waiting room for new quizzes

**Root Cause:**
- IP fetching could fail, resulting in 'unknown' IP
- Ban system only checked IP, not player ID
- No ban check on rejoin
- Warning message appeared even when ban was successful

**Solution:**
1. **Dual Ban System:** Ban by both player ID and IP (when available)
2. **Ban Check on Rejoin:** Prevent banned players from rejoining
3. **Improved Messaging:** Clear feedback about ban limitations
4. **Proper IP Handling:** Handle 'unknown' IP gracefully

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/TeacherQuizPage.jsx`
- `src/pages/TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx`

**Key Changes:**

**Kick Handler:**
```javascript
// Always ban by player ID, and also by IP if known
const bannedPlayerRef = ref(database, `game_sessions/${gameSessionId}/bannedPlayers/${playerId}`);
set(bannedPlayerRef, {
  name: player.name,
  ip: player.ip || 'unknown',
  bannedAt: Date.now(),
});

// Show appropriate message
if (!player.ip || player.ip === 'unknown') {
  alert(`Player "${player.name}" has been kicked and banned by ID. They cannot rejoin with the same browser, but may be able to rejoin from a different device.`);
}
```

**Ban Check (Join/Rejoin):**
```javascript
// Check if banned by IP (if IP is known) or by player ID
const isBannedByIp = ip !== 'unknown' && Object.values(bannedPlayers).some(player => player.ip === ip && player.ip !== 'unknown');
const isBannedById = existingPlayerId && bannedPlayers[existingPlayerId];

if (isBannedByIp || isBannedById) {
  alert('You have been banned from this game session.');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('playerId');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('playerName');
  navigate('/');
  return;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Timer Reset
1. Start a quiz with multiple questions
2. Let timer run on student view
3. Teacher clicks "Next" or "Previous"
4. Verify timer resets to full time for new question

### Rocket Race
1. Start a quiz with multiple students
2. Students answer questions with different scores
3. Navigate to feedback page
4. Verify rockets fly vertically from bottom to top
5. Verify each rocket displays its total points

### Presence Detection
1. Have students join quiz
2. Close student browser (don't just navigate away)
3. Wait 5-10 seconds
4. Verify student disappears from teacher's player list

### Ban System
1. Kick a student during quiz
2. Verify they're removed from player list
3. Try to rejoin from same browser → should be blocked
4. Try to rejoin from different browser → may work (expected behavior with unknown IP)
5. Verify appropriate messages are shown

## Technical Notes

### Firebase Presence Detection
- Uses `onDisconnect()` API which triggers when client loses connection
- Automatically cleans up disconnected players
- Must be set up on every page where player presence matters
- Survives page refreshes within same browser session

### Ban System Limitations
- IP-based bans only work when IP can be fetched
- Player ID bans work per-browser (uses sessionStorage)
- Students can bypass ID ban by clearing browser data or using different browser
- This is expected behavior for a classroom quiz app

### Timer Component
- Uses React `key` prop to force remount
- Alternative would be to use `useEffect` with dependency on question index
- Current solution is simpler and more reliable
