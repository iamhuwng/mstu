## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Complex Question Types** - Matching and diagram labeling may require significant UI/UX work
   - Mitigation: Create prototypes and gather user feedback early

2. **Performance Impact** - New animations could slow down app
   - Mitigation: Use `React.memo`, virtualization, and performance profiling

### Medium Risk
1. **Firebase Scaling** - More complex data structures might hit limits
   - Mitigation: Plan data structure carefully, consider Firestore migration

2. **Bundle Size Growth** - Adding features increases bundle
   - Mitigation: Aggressive code splitting and lazy loading
