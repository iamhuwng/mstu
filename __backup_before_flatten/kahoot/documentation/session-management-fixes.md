# Session Management Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Player Counter Showing 0 After End Session**
**Problem**: When teacher clicked "End Session", the `players` field was set to `null`, causing the player counter to show 0 even though students were still in the waiting room.

**Root Cause**: Multiple handler functions were setting `players: null` when ending sessions.

**Solution**: Modified all session-ending handlers to keep players but reset their scores and answers:
```javascript
const resetPlayers = {};
if (gameSession?.players) {
  Object.keys(gameSession.players).forEach(playerId => {
    resetPlayers[playerId] = {
      name: gameSession.players[playerId].name,
      ip: gameSession.players[playerId].ip || 'unknown',
      score: 0,
      answers: {}
    };
  });
}

update(gameSessionRef, {
  status: 'waiting',
  players: resetPlayers,  // Keep players instead of null
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
  isPaused: false
});
```

### 2. **Student View Blank Page on Second Question**
**Problem**: Students got a blank page when the second question loaded, with error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1761097976206-cuawz3sta')
at submitAnswer (StudentQuizPage.jsx:79:39)
```

**Root Cause**: The `submitAnswer` function tried to access `gameSession.players[playerId]` without checking if the players object or specific player exists. When timer triggered `handleTimeUp`, it called `submitAnswer` with potentially stale data.

**Solution**: Added safety checks before accessing player data:
```javascript
const submitAnswer = (answer) => {
  if (hasSubmittedRef.current || !gameSession || !quiz) return;

  const playerId = sessionStorage.getItem('playerId');
  
  // Check if players object exists and player is still in the session
  if (!gameSession.players || !gameSession.players[playerId]) {
    console.warn('Player not found in session, skipping answer submission');
    hasSubmittedRef.current = true;
    return;
  }
  
  // ... rest of submission logic
};
```

### 3. **IP Address Fetch Error (Minor)**
**Problem**: Console warning about blocked XHR request to `api.ipify.org`.

**Status**: This is a browser tracking prevention feature blocking the IP lookup. The code already handles this gracefully by using 'unknown' as fallback. No fix needed - this is expected behavior with tracking prevention enabled.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/pages/StudentQuizPage.jsx`
- Added safety check in `submitAnswer()` to verify players object and player existence
- Prevents undefined access errors when player data is missing

### 2. `src/pages/TeacherQuizPage.jsx`
- Modified `handleBack()` to keep players with reset scores
- Modified `handleEndSession()` to keep players with reset scores

### 3. `src/pages/TeacherResultsPage.jsx`
- Added `gameSession` state to track full session data
- Modified `handleReturnToLobby()` to keep players with reset scores

### 4. `src/pages/TeacherFeedbackPage.jsx`
- Modified `handleBack()` to keep players with reset scores
- Modified `handleEndSession()` to keep players with reset scores

## Testing Checklist

- [x] End Session from quiz page - players remain in waiting room
- [x] End Session from feedback page - players remain in waiting room
- [x] End Session from results page - players remain in waiting room
- [x] Player counter shows correct count after ending session
- [x] Students can join new quiz after previous session ended
- [x] Students don't get blank page on second question
- [x] Timer auto-submit works without errors
- [x] Player data persists across session resets
- [x] Scores and answers are properly reset

## Behavior Changes

### Before:
1. Teacher ends session → `players: null`
2. Students stay in waiting room but counter shows 0
3. Teacher starts new quiz → counter still shows 0
4. Students load first question successfully
5. Second question loads → student view crashes with undefined error

### After:
1. Teacher ends session → players kept with reset scores/answers
2. Students stay in waiting room and counter shows correct count
3. Teacher starts new quiz → counter shows correct count
4. Students load all questions successfully
5. No crashes or undefined errors

## Additional Notes

- Players are now persisted across session resets
- Only scores and answers are cleared when ending a session
- Player names and IP addresses are retained
- This allows for seamless session transitions without requiring students to rejoin
- The `isPaused: false` flag is set when resetting to ensure timer starts fresh
